<p>I'm a Software Engineer working in the Bay Area, CA. I've been writing macOS applications for the last three years in Swift, but started out by writing iOS apps in Obj-C. I'm a huge fan of TDD with a healthy curiosity for software architecture and an unhealthy obsession with refactoring code.</p>

<p>When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably wishing I was surfing or throwing a frisbee to the wrong team. However, I'm always trying to become a better developer, whether that means reading books, messing around in <a href="/projects">side projects</a>, or sharing ideas on my <a href="/blog">blog</a>.</p>
