<p class="next-to-head">I am a twenty-something year old software engineer who is a die-hard Longhorn fan with a tattoo to prove it.</p>

<p class="next-to-head">During the day, I am a software engineer at Apple. My focus is improving customer experience by triaging compatiblity issues with 3rd party applications on macOS, speaking with developers to enhance software compatibility, and creating internal tools to save time and avoid redundancies.</p>

<p class="next-to-shoulder">Outside of work, I'm always learning how to become a better software engineer -- whether that be testing out new ideas in a <a href="projects">side project</a> or keeping <a href="blog">notes on my experience</a> with new skills and practices that I discover.</p>
