I began teaching myself how to code in high school with the help from a few online videos. I formally studied Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin ðŸ¤˜, where I designed, developed, and deployed 4 fully-fledged iOS applications to the App Store. I've spent the majority of my carear as a Software Engineer at Apple, managing components in AppKit -- Apple's UI framework for macOS -- and triaging compatibility issues with 3rd party software. I've since joined Twitch, empowering communities to create together, by developing desktop applications for macOS.
